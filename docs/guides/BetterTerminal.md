First of all we need to install [**Homebrew**](https://brew.sh/)

```bash
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

This will install all the necessary requirements:

```bash
brew tap homebrew/cask-fonts
brew install zsh-autosuggestions zsh-syntax-highlighting git wget zsh
brew cask install iterm2 font-fira-code-nerd-font
```

Install [**Oh-My-Zsh**](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh)

```bash
sh -c "$(wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh -O -)"
```

**~/.zshrc Config Modifications for MacOS**

Set theme and fonts:

```bash
ZSH_THEME="bira"
```

Add this to the the end of ~/.zshrc

```bash
## Shell Integration and plugins
source /usr/local/share/zsh-syntax-highlighting/zsh-syntax-highlighting.zsh
source /usr/local/share/zsh-autosuggestions/zsh-autosuggestions.zsh
## Fix for Slow zsh-autosuggestions copy&paste
autoload -Uz bracketed-paste-magic

zstyle ':bracketed-paste-magic' active-widgets '.self-*'
```
